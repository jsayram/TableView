/* when you declare a class as implementing a UITableviewDataSource you need to provide certain methods here
 -- For now we will provide two methods,
 STEP 1: we need to provide how many list items that are going to be in our table view or ROWS.
 STEP 2: Define what is goin to be inside those Rows
 NOTE: Rows are the individual list items
 Sections are Groups of Rows
 
 1.) Getting tableView data into table view that repeats for each row for specied section
 2.) Getting tableView Data from an Array
 3.) How to Recycle or Reuse Table Views, in the case that you have a ton of data
 4.) Using a multidimentinal array for organizing the tableView Rows into Sections
 5.) Addint tittles or headers for each section in the group.

         then one for the second and two for the third. Now to get that data, it's actually stored
         inside this index path. If you put your cursor on index path and look at the quick health menu,
         and it says it represents the path to a specific note in a tree of nested array collections.*/

Now the Attributes Inspector has several different settings for your table view, including how the data is organized, colors of cells, etc. So you can modify those here should you choose. To reuse the cells however, we're going to need to add a prototype cell. Make sure that in your Table View section you have Content set to Dynamic Prototypes.
         
         In here you want to add a prototype cell by clicking the up arrow, so now I have this one Prototype Cell right here, and if you click on that cell then you're going to see this area inside of the Attributes Inspector. You should see that you have a Table View Cell selected. For the style, I'm going to leave Custom and for the Identifier, I'm going to type "cell", so this comes from the string that we set earlier in the dequeueResuableCell method, so if we change that "cell" string to something else, then you need to use that something else in your storyboard as well.*/

        cell.textLabel?.text = data[indexPath.section][indexPath.row]  //this gets section,then the row == the item in each array
        return cell
        
        /*Now go back to storyBoard to choose how the sections are presented, so in the storyboard select the table-view and then under style, in the attributes inspector, I'm going to change from plain to grouped. Now if we do that and we test the application, now the items are broken up into obvious groups, there we go. So we successfully grouped our table-views by handling number of sections in table-view and by using a multidimensional array.
         
         So now if we wanted to add another group, we just add another one of our arrays into this multidimensional array. We can also add additional items or remove items, they don't need to have the same amount. We can put all of our data in here and it will show up in the table-view properly. If you want to customize the appearance of the groups in your table-view, you can always modify the separator, settings, and you can modify the colors, you can do all of this through the attributes inspector.
         
         So by using this multidimensional array, we can make any modifications that we want and the data will show up properly and organized within the table-view.*/
